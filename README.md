This study presents a low-cost, real-time health monitoring system utilizing an ultrasonic sensor, a PIR motion sensor, and a Bluetooth module interfaced with an Arduino Nano. The system is designed to detect a person's breathing rate, movement, and potential distress conditions. The ultrasonic sensor measures chest movement to calculate breath rate, while the PIR sensor detects motion to confirm if the person is alive. The HC-05 Bluetooth module transmits the collected data to a mobile device for remote monitoring. This project aims to provide an accessible and efficient solution for health monitoring in resource-constrained environments, offering potential applications in elderly care, patient monitoring, emergency response scenarios, and accident detection. Additionally, the system can be employed in road accident scenarios to determine whether an injured individual is alive and, if so, transmit their breathing rate to medical personnel for immediate action.
